## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn (KNN or Logistic Regression)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Analysis
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Train K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) or Logistic Regression model
- Evaluate results with confusion matrix and accuracy score 


## 📂 Dataset
Iris dataset — includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) from kaggle 


## 🎯 Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand real-world ML classification workflows including data processing, model training, evaluation with confusion matrix, and interpreting accuracy metrics.
